## How to update the README.md

The README is generated using [mdoc]() from the README source so that all code examples are compiled, run, and its output added to the code block. When updating the README the source needs to be updated, which can be found in [/docs/](docs/README.md). Then one needs to regenerate the README using the `sbt:root> docs/mdoc` command.
